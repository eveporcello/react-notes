# 02_01 - Adding React to your Project

One of the fastest ways of getting started with a React project is to add a link to the React library to an HTML page.

If you take a look at the exercise files, I took the first step of adding links to the CDN of React. CDN stands for content delivery network and think of this link as being a quick way of adding the React library to your page in the browser, so that all of the functions and features you might need from React are preloaded.

Once added to the page, you can start to create your first element using React. Right now we have an h1, a heading, on the page. Let's say I wanted to display this using React instead of HTML.

## Create the Rendering Target

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

## Use ReactDOM.render to add the element to the page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  ReactDOM.render(
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Getting Started!"),
    document.getElementById("root")
  );
</script>
```
