# 06_03 - Using the App Router

- When we created the project, we chose to build using the App Router.
- If you're using version 14+ of Next.js, all of your files will be placed in the App Router folder called `app`.
- At the root of the app folder is a file called `page.js`
- this is what will be displayed if we go to the slash route
- The component can be called anything but needs to be exported as a default (either function or object)

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <div className="z-10 w-full max-w-5xl items-center justify-between font-mono text-sm lg:flex">
        <div
          className="relative h-96 w-full bg-cover bg-center"
          style={{ backgroundImage: `url(skiing.jpg)` }}
        ></div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
```

- Create a folder called `hotels`
- Create a file at the root called `page.js`
- This shows how we can create routes. `page.js` will be displayed if we go to the slash hotels route

```javascript
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hotels</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

- By default this is a server component.
- Show in the dev tools how the page is being rendered as static HTML.
- This pattern assists with performance and improved SEO.
