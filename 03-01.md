# 03_01 - Creating a React Component

Now that we have an understanding of how to create elements, we want to create our first component. Think of a component like being a little building block. It's a piece of the user interface that we'll use to describe one part of our application.

```jsx
function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <h1>Eve's Kitchen</h1>
    </header>
  );
}

function Main() {
  return (
    <section>
      <p>We serve the most delicious food around</p>
    </section>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<Main />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

Add the div around the components

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <div>
    <Header />
    <Main />
  </div>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
