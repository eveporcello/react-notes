# 04_05 - useEffect

Another important hook that's part of the React library is useEffect. useEffect can feel a little tricky, because it's typically used to manage side effects that aren't related to a component's render.

console messages, loading data, and sometimes working with animations can benefit from useEffect. Let's take a basic look at useEffect then later in the course, we'll use it to fetch data.

1. Import use effect
2. Log the current emotion.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`It's ${emotion} around here!`);
});
```
