# 02_05 - Working with JSX Syntax

As you work with react and JSX together, you'll start to notice how powerful JSX actually is. We can use it to inject dynamic content into our tags simply by referencing them by variable name.

```javascript
let robot = "ü§ñ";
let cowboy = "ü§†";
let moon = "üåù";

ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>
    <li>{robot}</li>
    <li>{cowboy}</li>
    <li>{moon}</li>
  </ul>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

- Displaying Data

```javascript
let cities = [
  { name: "Tokyo", population: 13960000 },
  { name: "London", population: 8982000 },
  { name: "Tahoe City", population: 2147 }
];

ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>
    {cities.map((city) => (
      <li>
        {city.name} | {city.population} people
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

So JSX is a really powerful way that we can inject dynamic content into our apps.
