# What You Should Know

Learning React is an intro to React, but I am going to assume that you’re taking this course with some front-end development skills already in place.

React is built out of JavaScript - so it might be helpful to know a bit of JavaScript. If you aren’t familiar with JavaScript, I’d recommend JavaScript Essential Training with Morten Rand-Hendriksen.

The course will also use some of the latest JavaScript syntax. You'll pick that up in Morten's JavaScript class, but my course Learning ECMAScript6 could be a good supplement.

That should be about it!
