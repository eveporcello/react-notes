# 03_05 - Images

Now that we know how to add text to our React app, let's add an image. This can feel confusing, but we can add images to our React apps just like we do with HTML.

To start, we'll decide where to place the image. So let's just put this thing right in our main component.

```javascript
import restaurant from "./restaurant.jpg";

<img src={restaurant} height={200} />;
```

Can also put in a URL

```javascript
<img
  src="https://github.com/eveporcello.png"
  height={200}
/>
```

Switch back to restaurant then make it accessible

```javascript
<img
  src={restaurant}
  height={200}
  alt="napkin and fork at a restaurant table"
/>
```
