# 03_04 Add Keys

In the previous video, we rendered a list of menu items dynamically. Meaning that if I added another item to the list, my UI would update automatically. But we saw an error in the console about a key. Click on the docs link.

Possible that things might get out of sync when rendering occurs -- particularly if something is added to the DOM at the beginning or middle instead of the end of the list.

A key is like an id that helps keep everything in sync. And of course, it's JavaScript right? So there are a couple of ways to handle this.

First, we could just add an index.

```javascript
{
  dishes.map((dish, i) => <li key={i}>{dish}</li>);
}
```

The React docs recommend against this because it says there can be problems with rendering. Which is kind of not the point of keys in the first place.

```javascript
const dishObjects = dishes.map((dish, i) => ({
  id: i,
  title: dish
}));
console.log(dishObjects);
```

Isn't that amazing? I feel so alive now. Update the props

```javascript
<Main adjective="amazing" dishes={dishObjects} />
```

Isn't this the same because we're using an index again? Not really, because the data is stable. Created in this function instead of being created while the list items are rendering.

Your data might already look like this too. So you can just use an id or other unique field as the key if you're dealing with an array of objects.

Keys help keep your data in sync as your application's state changes throughout time.
